This is an Expo/React Native mobile application. Prioritize mobile-first patterns, performance, and cross-platform compatibility.

## How to work with this project

This is a **learning project** — the owner is working through the problem themselves and only wants code, edits, or commands run on their behalf when explicitly asked. By default:

- **Don't edit files.** Provide explanations, reasoning, and code snippets in chat. The owner will apply changes.
- **Don't run state-changing commands** (installs, builds, git writes, etc.) without explicit permission.
- **Read-only inspection is fine** when needed to give an accurate answer (listing files, reading file contents, searching the codebase, reading docs).
- If the owner asks a question that can be answered from existing code/context, answer it directly — no need to invoke tools.
- When code snippets are provided in chat, include full file contents and exact code, not partial diffs, so the owner can paste them in cleanly.

Project state, what's been built, what's blocked, and what's next lives in `PROJECT.md` — keep it in sync as the owner makes progress. If asked to update `PROJECT.md`, do so; otherwise treat it as a read-only reference.

## Expo has changed — do not trust your training data

Expo ships breaking changes every SDK release. APIs you remember are likely renamed, moved, or removed. Before writing any code that touches an Expo, EAS, or React Native API:

1. Read the major version of the `expo` package in `package.json`.
2. Fetch the matching versioned docs: `https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v<major>.0.0/`
3. For anything else, fetch https://docs.expo.dev/llms.txt — an index of all Expo docs with corrections to common LLM misconceptions. Follow its links to the specific page you need; never answer from memory.

## Commands

Use `bunx` instead of `npx` — this project uses bun (`bun.lock` is present).

```bash
bunx expo install <package>  # ALWAYS use instead of npm/yarn/pnpm/bun add — resolves SDK-compatible versions
bunx expo start              # start the dev server
bunx expo lint               # lint
bunx tsc --noEmit            # typecheck
bunx expo-doctor             # diagnose dependency and config issues
bunx expo install --fix      # fix incompatible package versions
```

Run lint and typecheck before declaring any task done.

## Navigation & Routing

- Use **Expo Router** for all navigation. Routes live in `src/app/` — every file there is a screen, `_layout.tsx` files define navigators. Keep non-route code (components, hooks, utils) outside `src/app/`.
- Import `Link`, `router`, and `useLocalSearchParams` from `expo-router`.
- Docs: https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction.md

## Building with EAS

Use EAS to build, sign, and submit the app in the cloud (`eas build`, `eas submit`) and to ship over-the-air updates (`eas update`) — no local Xcode or Android Studio required. Run EAS CLI as `bunx eas-cli <command>`; substitute that for bare `eas` in docs examples.

## Rules

- If `ios/` and `android/` directories do not exist, they are generated (Continuous Native Generation). Never create or edit them by hand — configure native behavior in `app.json` and config plugins.
- Expo Go only includes its bundled native modules. After adding a library with native code, the app needs a development build: `bunx expo run:ios|android` locally, or `eas build --profile development`.
- Prefer recommended Expo modules over third-party libraries, and check your available skills before adding dependencies. Docs: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/index.md
